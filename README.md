Python & tkinter

Here's a summary of creating a simple calculator using Python and Tkinter:

Imports: Import the tkinter module.

Functions:

button_click(item): Updates the entry widget with the clicked button's text.
clear(): Clears the entry widget.
evaluate(): Evaluates the expression in the entry widget and displays the result.
Main Window:

Create the main application window using tk.Tk().
Set the window title.
Entry Widget:

Create an entry widget to display input and output using tk.Entry().
Place the entry widget in a grid layout.
Buttons:

Create buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), clear (C), and equals (=).
Arrange buttons in a grid layout.
Assign appropriate command functions to each button.
Run the Application:

Start the application's main loop using root.mainloop().

Explanation:
Imports: We import the tkinter module.
Functions: We define functions to handle button clicks, clear the entry, and evaluate the expression.
Main Window: We create the main window and set its title.
Entry Widget: This is where the user inputs numbers and sees the results.
Buttons: We create buttons for digits, operators, clear, and equals, and arrange them in a grid layout.
Main Loop: Finally, we run the main loop to start the application.
